The footer no longer redirects to a separate sitemap page, as the sitemap is nowhere near elaborate enough to warrant its own page. The sitemap is in the footer itself. We also added social media links to the footer, and our logo is on the header of the page. The header text and the logos link to index.html for easy navigation. The footer even features a "back to top" link!</td>

The reviews are now random on page load, and the index slideshow starts on a random image, then loads in order and loops the slideshow at the end. The height of the header image automatically adjusts to the header image, as the slideshow images and the random headers for non-index pages have a different height.</td>

As opposed to writing the orders to a server-side textfile, the page now posts the forms via email to the client. This method was suggested by the project roadmap, so we changed the page to use it. The page also warns you if one of the required fields are empty, and the method of selecting how many and which pizzas you want has been reworked.</td>

                    <td>template.js is our attempt at modularity. In this javascript file we utilize jQuery to access two SSI documents, namely header.part and footer.part. The header and footer are the same on every page, so we figured it'd make sense to load it as a template, so that any changes to those files would apply to all our html pages. After the header is loaded up, a callback function goes into the nav and highlights the current page in the navbar. It's all very dynamic and fun. Most of our JavaScript applies to all our pages, so the code is in external files.</td>

            <h2> Updated Organizational Scheme </h2>
            <p>
                The changes here were primarily regarding the images and the general structure of the files. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All these files are inside the public_html directory. Next to that directory is index.html, which automatically directs users to the actual index page in the pages folder. The images have been categorized so that we don't just have a mess of images in a single folder. The pages folder is mere preference, doesn't really impact the site in any meaningful way. Here is our list of files and folders:
