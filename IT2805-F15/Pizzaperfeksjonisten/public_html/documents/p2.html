            <h2> 2. Administrative Details </h2>
            <p>Our client is the imaginary pizza makers "Pizza Perfeksjonisten". As such we do not have a specific contact person.</p>

            <h2> 3. Purpose, goals and audience </h2>
            <p>
                Pizza Perfeksjonisten's goals is to sell their great pizzas at great prices, and wish to reach out to the public through this webpage. They wish their webpage to have a clean, slick look with a user friendly design that makes the task of ordering a pizza sheer fun. The navigation should be simple and flawless, and all subsections should be found by ease. Through the site, Pizza Perfeksjonisten also wishes to advertise their take-away offer, where they deliver the pizza to your doorstep. The webpage should therefore contain an easy ordering system, where the user can complete the entire order using only their computer.
            </p>

            <h2> 4. Navigation Structure </h2>
            <p>
                When deciding the navigation structure of the website we went with a structure where the user is able to access all other pages from any given page. This is done through the navigation bar at the top of the page with two roll-over menus. A graph of the navigation structure is shown below.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The reason we chose this structure was make the website as easy as possible to navigate and to make it easy for the user to find the different pages and subpages. Otherwise users might have trouble finding some of the subpages.

            <h2> 5. Page Layout and Appearance </h2>
            <p>
                When coming up with the universal design, we focused on creating a welcoming and warm color scheme and layout. We want our web page to have a clean, slick look with a user-friendly design. Navigating the site should be easy, and all subpages will be located on the navigation bar in drop down menus. The design should make customers feel welcome, and will make the site easy to use for people of all ages. The ordering page will be simple and modern, and easy to find for all users.

            <p>
                This is the specific styling we will be use on all pages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Font: We use “Helvetica” for all of the text as font-family, with standard sans-serif for backup. The main text is font size 16px, and the main header (h1) is 72px. The text in the navigation bar is the same size as the main text, 16px. The text in the navbar, and the heading for the page and the image description is capitalized to increase readability. The text in the navbar and the headers are also bold. </li>
                <li>Color Scheme
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text: Black</li>
                        <li>Background: White (FFFFFF)</li>
                        <li>Links: Orange (FF9736)</li>
                        <li>Navbar: Background is a near-black color (4D4D4D), but when highlighted or when you're on that particular page, the background color is the same orange color that is prevalent in the rest of the page (FF9736). The text is pure white.</li>
                        <li>Headers: All headers that aren't on the image description, are orange (FF9736).</li>
                        <li>Image description: The text here is pure white.</li>
                        <li>Footer: Near-black background color (4D4D4D) with white text.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Body width: 1000px;</li>
                <li>Links: The main title “Pizza Perfeksjonisten” will be a clickable link which will bring users back to the home page. The menu sections will have drop-down menus that can be clicked and contain links to the respective pages.</li>
                <li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included at the top of the page. When the mouse hovers over the tabs within the menu bar, subpages will appear in a drop-down menu. When the mouse is on a certain tab, the background of the link will turn to orange. The navbar will follow the user as you scroll down the page, thanks to javascript.</li>
                <li>Banner: The banner will be "Pizza Perfeksjonisten" written in Helvetica, as seen at the top of the mock-up picture.</li>
                <li>Footer: In the footer we plan to include a basic sitemap that will also link to a seperate sitemap page. We're also considering inserting social media links such as twitter, facebook and the likes. </li>
                  <li>Images: After corresponding with Peppes Pizza, we have been given permission to use their generic pizza images for our website. We obviously won't use images that include Peppes Pizza branding, but that will help us get high-quality images of pizza.</li>
                <li>Background Images: The background we're using is a repeating pattern that doesn't necessarily relate to pizza, but the color scheme of our page is built around its colors, and the background keeps the page from looking too dull. The background was downloaded from http://thepatternlibrary.com/#wild-sea The patterns from this page are available to use freely in all designs, as is specified by the page.</li>
                <li>Logo: We do not have a logo ready just yet, but it is in the works by a graphic designer.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                We are planning to include the four following scripts in our project. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A function that fixes the navbar so the user does not lose it whille scrolling through our beautiful webpage.</li>
                <li>The second javascript function is for implementing a roll over menu on the navbar.</li>
                <li>The next javascript is for the form submitting part. This script is for sending us the order information. </li>
                <li>The fourth JS document is for the slideshow on the frontpage and on the ”resturant” page.  </li>
                <li>In a fifth JS script we will implement some sort of animation in the pizza menu where we will display addded information and review about the different pizzas. This information will appear as a box next to or over the pizza as the user either hovers or clicks the specific item. </li>
